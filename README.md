## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Display Flex


### What I learned

I had problems with how to define the color of the list marking elements, I researched some videos and now I know how it works

I also had a problem with the last nutrition div, I looked at other solutions here on the platform and saw index.html there I learned that there is a table tag, I researched its documentation and understood how it works

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
------------------------HTML-------------------------

<table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Calories</th>
          <td>277Kcal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Carbs</th>
          <td>0g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Protein</th>
          <td>20g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Fat</th>
          <td>22g</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
```
